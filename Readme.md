* GoalNet offers football enthusiasts a platform to connect, discuss their favorite teams and players, and engage in vibrant football-related conversations.
* Using React, ContextAPI, and React-Router, I created an intuitive frontend.
* On the backend, I built a REST API using Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose for data management. 
* To enhance user interaction, I integrated Socket.IO for real-time chatting functionality.
